# Minimal klib for filter_N_seq

This `lib` folder contains the minimal set of files from the original klib library required to build and use `filter_N_seq`.

- `kseq.h`: FASTA/FASTQ parser (patched for C++ compatibility)
- `kstring.h`: Minimal string structure and macros used by `kseq.h`
- `LICENSE.txt`: MIT license from klib

If you need more klib features, copy additional headers as needed from the original klib repository.
